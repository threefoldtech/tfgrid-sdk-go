tfrobot is tool designed to automate mass deployment of groups of VMs on ThreeFold Grid, with support of multiple retries for failed deployments

## Features

- **Mass Deployment:** Deploy groups of vms on ThreeFold Grid simultaneously.
- **Mass Cancellation:** Cancel all vms on ThreeFold Grid defined in configuration file simultaneously.
- **Load Deployments:** Load gorups of vms deployed using TFRobot simultaneously.
- **Customizable Configurations:** Define Node groups, VMs groups and other configurations through YAML or JSON file.

## Download

1.  Download the binaries from [releases](https://github.com/threefoldtech/tfgrid-sdk-go/releases)
2.  Extract the downloaded files
3.  Move the binary to any of `$PATH` directories, for example:

```bash
mv tfrobot /usr/local/bin
```

4.  Create a new configuration file, for example config.yaml:

```yaml
node_groups:
  - name: group_a
    nodes_count: 3
    free_cpu: 2
    free_mru: 16
    free_ssd: 100
    free_hdd: 50
vms:
  - name: examplevm
    vms_count: 5
    node_group: group_a
    cpu: 1
    mem: 0.25
    flist: example-flist
    entry_point: example-entrypoint
    root_size: 0
    ssh_key: example1
    env_vars:
      user: user1
      pwd: 1234
ssh_keys:
  example1: ssh_key1
mnemonic: example-mnemonic
network: dev
max_retries: 5
```

You can use this [example](./example/conf.yaml) for further guidance,
>**Please** make sure to replace placeholders and adapt the groups based on your actual project details.

>**Note:** All storage resources are expected to be in GB.

>**Note:** The VMs may utilize a different number of nodes than requested due
to the retries filtering out additional nodes in case of failure.
Consequently, it's possible to utilize more nodes than initially requested.

5.  Run the deployer with path to the config file

```bash
tfrobot deploy -c path/to/your/config.yaml
```

> Ensure that memory precision does not exceed 0.001,
any value greater than this threshold will be disregarded.
> In case of YAML input, floating point portion of int values will be ignored.

## Usage

### Subcommands

- **deploy:** used to mass deploy groups of vms with specific configurations

```bash
tfrobot deploy -c path/to/your/config.yaml
```

- **cancel:** used to cancel all vms deployed using specific configurations

```bash
tfrobot cancel -c path/to/your/config.yaml
```

- **load:** used to load all vms deployed using specific configurations

```bash
tfrobot load -c path/to/your/config.yaml
```

### Flags

| Flag | Usage |
| :---:   | :---: |
| -c | used to specify path to configuration file |
| -o | used to specify path to output file to store the output info in |
| -d | allow debug logs to appear in the output logs |
| -h | help |
> **Note:** Parsing is based on file extension, json format if the file had json extension, yaml format otherwise

> **Note:** Make sure to use every flag once. If the flag is repeated, it will ignore all values and take the last value of the flag.

## Using Docker

```bash
docker build -t tfrobot -f Dockerfile ../
docker run -v $(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml -it tfrobot:latest deploy -c /config.yaml
```

## Build

To build the deployer locally clone the repo and run the following command inside the repo directory:

```bash
make build
```

## Test

To run the deployer tests run the following command inside the repo directory:

```bash
make test
```

## Logs

To ensure a complete log history, append `2>&1 | tee path/to/log/file`
to the command being executed.

```bash
tfrobot deploy -c path/to/your/config.yaml 2>&1 | tee path/to/log/file
```
